# Easy Push-Ups
## Automated Deployment with Ansible

Presented by 

Edward Delaporte, Software Developer for Busey Bank

Joanna Delaporte, Systems Administrator for Parkland College

---

## What is Ansible

- [Simple IT Automation](https://www.ansible.com/)
- Configuration
- Deployment

???

    Introduce/ explain the name Ansible
Our Experience with Ansible

---

## Why Bother With Ansible?

- As a developer, I need to know that my problem was not the deployment.
- I need boring push-ups.
- Deployment is: file copy, permissions, web config, app config, host dependencies, host config

??? 
        Ansible is reliable and repeatable. 
        File copy is reliable and repeatable, but deployment is a lot more than file copy.

---

## Why Bother With Ansible?

- As an administrator, I love parallel efficiency. I value stable custom configuration.
- As an administrator, I need repeatability. 

??? 

The desired state needs to be achieved, no matter how many times I apply a configuration. 
Shells are limited by their environment and available commands. Ansible can do anything python or bash or PowerShell can do. 

---

## Things Ansible Does
- Update a custom web app
- Harden security settings
- Install EPEL
- Setup networking
- Provision a new AWS host!
- Create user accounts
- Update Windows (New!)

???
 (Add lots of Examples)

---

## Get Started with Ansible

You need:
- [Inventory File aka Hosts File](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html) on Ansible Control Machine
- SSH Access to the target machine.
- Sudo rights on the target machine (for most tasks)
- [Ansible Command Line Reference](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_adhoc.html)

???

Tips
- All you need is SSH Access and Sudo rights on the target.
- You need sudo access as normal on the target (most configurations)
- AWS = Amazon Web Services
- pip install boto on the Ansible control machine / hive queen
- Usually start with Root password.
- For AWS, use AWS user secret and secret key as ENV variables or modules arguments.

---

## Getting Things Done with Ansible

### Start Using Playbooks
- [Ansible Module Index](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules_by_category.html)
- [Ansible Guide to AWS](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/guide_aws.html)
- [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)

???


TODO: Show a Hosts file.

TODO: Show Ansible Galaxy
    Mention and link to Jeff Gearling and Burt VV - creators of great Ansible roles

Give example commands to check out a playbook from Ansible galaxy.

Show the -VVVV flag. (Debug your playbooks)
Link a Guide to SSH. (Use it to do anything Ansible cannot yet do)

Give example commands to contribute to an Ansible Galaxy playbook.
    Or Link to a Guide to Git? (Use it to track / share your own work.)
