# Easy Push-Ups
## Automated Deployment with Ansible

Presented by Edward Delaporte (on behalf of Busey Bank)

and Joanna Delaporte (for Parkland College)

???

# How to use ReMark

Open this file in a browser to see the slide deck. Open it in a text editor to work with the Markdown.
Press P to see your presentation notes and a presentation timer.
Press C to clone a copy for your second monitor.
Arrow keys to go forward or back a slide.
Note that both HTML img tags or MarkDown image tags work here, but HTML img tag is easier to style.

---

# This is another slide.

- It can have a list of bullet points.
- Or a picture.
- Or a short block of example code.

???

These notes appear only to the presenter.

# The Developer and The Admin can be Friends

## Admin Flaws
Worry too much.
Don't like having fun.

## Developer Flaws
Never write anything down.
Nothing they build works.

## Developer Lens
People need this to work, right now!
Deployment is boring, I don't want to think about it.

## Admin Lens
People need this to work tomorrow and every day after.
Deployment *should* be boring, we probably *should* think about it.

## Shared Lenses
I can't reliably do my job unless I know that what we tried to deploy got fully deployed, where it needs to go.

Ansible is a DevOps tool.
Other DevOps tools: PowerShell, MSI, RPM, Git, KShell
DevOps philosophy is that Development and Operations are a team.
    - Both should write Ansible Playbooks
    - Both should be able to run Playbooks
    - Both should be able to maintain playbooks

---

# Ansible Philosophy

---

# Example Playbook
.small[
```YAML
---
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
    yum: name=httpd state=latest
  - name: write the apache config file
    template: src=/srv/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd.conf
    notify:
    - restart apache
  - name: ensure apache is running (and enable it at boot)
    service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
  handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      service: name=httpd state=restarted
```
]

---

# Example Commands

Run a playbook:
```BASH
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

---

# Ansible Verbosity

```BASH
-VVVV
```

???

Also controls SSH verbosity.

---

# Bonus Slide: Make a Makefile

```Make
deploy:
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml

```

???

Not exactly what Make is for.
But pretty much what Make is for.
Even non-Make users can read your exact commands and even and paste them.
